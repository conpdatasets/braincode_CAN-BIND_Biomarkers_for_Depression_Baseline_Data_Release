# Overview

The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) is a national program of research and learning. From 2013 to 2017, data were collected from 211 participants with major depressive disorder and 112 healthy individuals. The objective of this data-set is to integrate detailed clinical, imaging, and molecular data to predict outcome for patients experiencing a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and receiving pharmacotherapy reflective of standard practice. The clinical characterization consists of symptom assessment, behavioural dimensions, and environmental factors. The neuroimaging data consist of structural, resting and task-based functional, and diffusion-weighted MRI images, as well as scalp-recorded EEG data. The molecular data consist of DNA methylation, inflammatory markers and urine metabolites.  Baseline and Phase 1 (Weeks 2-8) data are now available for request.

# Data organization

Data is organized into packages by Treatment Group (Control vs Major Depressive Disorder), Timepoint Imaging Scan Type, Molecular Data Type, and Clinical Data Collection Domain.
